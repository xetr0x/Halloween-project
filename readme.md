HI This game was made by Kevin Wilusz. 
This game is free to use and will be at least portable with the computer and hopefully with phones and ipads as well. 
the assets and sprites are'nt made by me, though I used them and made the map wholly by my self. 
For the map assets (walls, ground, keys, drain, skulls, blood and torch) credit goes to Atole6 (link to the assets: https://atole6.itch.io/2d-titleset-doungeon).
